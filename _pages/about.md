Hi, I am a fourth (and final!) year PhD student in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edee-electrical-engineering/) and [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/), Switzerland, under the supervision of [Andrei Popescu-Belis](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/), on Natural Language Processing, and specifically Machine Translation and Language Generation.

I have mainly worked on low-resourced languages or domains, and I am interested in improving neural models in these situations by constraining them, either during training with regularization or additional tasks, or during inference with rules, for instance.

Before starting my PhD, I did my masters on [Cognitive Science](http://www.ub.edu/ccil/), with a master's thesis on cross-lingual sentiment analysis under the supervision of [Toni Badia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Toni-Badia) and [Jeremy Barnes](https://jerbarnes.github.io/), in [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/), in Barcelona.

Before that, I earned a bachelor's degree in Philosophy at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/), specializing in Logic, and Philosophy of Language and Science.
