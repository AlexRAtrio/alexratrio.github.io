Hi, I'm a third year PhD student in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edee-electrical-engineering/) and [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/), Switzerland, under the supervision of [Andrei Popescu-Belis](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/), on Natural Language Processing, and specifically Machine Translation and Language Generation.

I have mainly worked on low-resourced languages or domains, and I'm interested in improving neural models in these situations by constraining them, either during training with regularization or additional tasks, or during inference with rules, for instance.

Before my starting my PhD, in Barcelona I did my masters on [Cognitive Science](http://www.ub.edu/ccil/), and performed my master's thesis on cross-lingual sentiment analysis under the supervision of [Toni Badia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Toni-Badia) and [Jeremy Barnes](https://jerbarnes.github.io/), in [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/).

Even before that, I studied my bachelors in Philosophy at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/), specializing in Logic, and Philosophy of Language and Science.
