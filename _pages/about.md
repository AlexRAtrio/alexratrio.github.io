Hi, I am a Senior Deep Learning Scientist at [Pi School](https://picampus-school.com/), in Rome, Italy. I am working in [LLM4EO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/llm4eo), an open-source LLM for Earth Observation and Earth Sciences, a project in collaboration with [Φ-lab](https://philab.esa.int/), the Earth Observation innovation lab at the [European Space Agency - ESA](https://www.esa.int/). 

Work on the project involves data gathering, continued pre-training, instruction fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks, alignment, and retrieval augmented generation. 

Before that (2024), I completed my PhD (“Regularization Techniques for Low-Resource Machine Translation”) in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edee-electrical-engineering/) and [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/) (Switzerland) under the supervision of [Andrei Popescu-Belis](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/), on Natural Language Processing, and specifically Machine Translation and Language Generation.

I have mainly worked on low-resourced languages or domains, both in machine translation and language generation. I have worked on improving sequence-to-sequence models by studying the relation between regularization and the flatness of their loss landscape. I have also worked with multilingual and multitask models, and studied how to train more efficient machine translation systems. Regarding text generation with language models, I have studied both rules-based, hybrid, and neural (with synthetic data creation) generation on low-resource domains.

Before starting my PhD, I did my masters on [Cognitive Science](http://www.ub.edu/ccil/), with a master's thesis on cross-lingual sentiment analysis under the supervision of [Toni Badia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Toni-Badia) and [Jeremy Barnes](https://jerbarnes.github.io/), in [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/), in Barcelona.

Before that, I earned a bachelor's degree in Philosophy at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/), specializing in Logic, and Philosophy of Language and Science.
